# Maze-Generator
A Javascript maze generator that uses recursive backtracking to simiulate the carving of a NxN maze.
Once the maze is generated, breadth-first-search is used to find the shortest path from the leftmost corner
to the rightmosts bottom corner. A slider is also available to alter/adjust the size of the maze.
